# Vish's Interests

For a day job, I work in distributed systems, but that is not "who" I am. While I really enjoy doing the work, I am maintaing this blog for my personal writing about topics I find interesting. 

I am mostly interested in football, f1, cooking, politics and tech policy. I use this space to write about these random topics.
